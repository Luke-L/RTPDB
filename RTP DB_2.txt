Notes:

 

My goal in creating this database was to document conversations/stories/moments/etc. that people might want to locate/go back to or that I thought were worth noting.
I tried to describe things as best as I could with several keywords to make them easier to find.
It's even easier to search if you can search with wildcards/RegEx (Regular Expression), for example- "Burnie.*steak.*hotel" will bring up all the instances that has those keywords in the same line (at least when dot isn't configured to match new-lines).
Whenever there were stories/conversations/subjects (including related ones) that came up across several podcasts I tried to gather them up together to make them easier to locate (since searching by keywords doesn't always bring up the right conversation and so this way you only need to find one of the related conversations.)
The timestamps are based on:
#1-#490 - YouTube version
#491-#557 - RT site version
#558-#593 - First version on the RT site
#594 forward - YouTube version
For a collection of useful/interesting lists like science conversations/hypotheticals/quotes/etc. check the Database Lite
If you have any suggestions/questions you can contact me on Reddit
For some reason the justpaste.it domain is hard-banned on Reddit (which means even mods can't approve the post/comment that links to it) and so if you want to mention it on Reddit you should write it as: justpaste . it/9gcuj

Not everything from the RTAAs is included in this database.

  3:41-5:43/8:25-9:47 Gus and Burnie were invited to the Frag Dolls party and they said they would come but then didn't show up because of the dress code ("The rules were changed after promises were made", didn't allow t-shirts or sneakers/etc.)

      (also mentioned during:) #81 at (8:46-) 9:05-11:24 Joel was told to MC a costume context (cosplay contest, they sprung it on him, at A-Kon [A-Con], didn't have a tuxedo), Joel didn't know any of the people, a guy in the third row kept making fun of him so he called him to the stage to MC with him, had to vamp for an hour with Dan on the stage.
  (6:11~7:00 Burnie already made the Frag Dolls mad once by talking to them while they were in an Assassin's Creed cosplay, while they weren't supposed to talk.

          #55 at 51:13-51:44 During the Drunk Gamers days they joked about having a premium sponsor model where you would see all of the E's that were missing all over the website (because E is the most common letter and consumed the most bandwidth, missing letter, scrapped prank)

          #173 at 11:06 Burnie explains that they landed before they took off when they left Japan
      #173 at 5:16-6:52/8:23~8:50 Furthest timezone point from where you are, Gavin: "being at the front of time", GMT is the center of time so +12/+14 is the front of time, international date line, furthest point geographically but not furthest in time
      #173 at 8:23-12:57 Argument, [science] Gavin: "One day lasts for 50 hours on the whole planet" (one date lasts../a day lasts../a date.., 26 timezones, -12 to +14) [when a date starts in a +14 timezone it will only start 26 hours later in a -12 timezone and will last there for additional 24 hours (so 26+24=50)], then Burnie tries to explain it when he finally understands what Gavin is saying (flying across date lines) and then Gus understands, skipping over the international date line from +14 to -12 after spending 24 hours at +14, going in circles in the North Pole where the timezones meet.

          #526 Post Show at ~4:19 Getting more hours in a day while flying through different timezones (for a fitness challenge in a watch, standing every hour, more than 24 hours in one day)
      #173 at 13:12~14:20 Getting rid of timezones, everybody should have the same time across the world (same timezone), it should just mean something different depending on where you are (2 a.m. for example will be different based on location), Gavin: it wouldn't be like that on a new planet, 15:45-16:06 China has one timezone
            #330 at 15:47~17:20 also (+or at least having one timezone for each country)

      #173 at 17:00-17:20 Can you skip your birthday?
          #216 at 50:20-52:50 Argument, they try to convince Gavin that you lose a day when you fly to Australia and back (losing a day/skipping a day/skip a day, taking off on Monday and landing on Wednesday you lose Tuesday, a date on the calendar that you don't experience)
          #367 at ~55:15 Chris skipped his birthday while on a plane to RTX Australia ("I remember it as Tuesday because it felt like it didn't happen", "how cool would it be if my birthday was one day later and it didn't exist")

      #516 Post Show at 8:58~15:10 Burnie's phonecall to the U.K. (Burnie missed the call), argument, GMT during Daylight Savings Time (BST/DST), 'we had daylight savings time so we're not on GMT in London but we still say GMT'
              #532 at ~1:00:00 revisit of the argument
      #519 at 1:04:23~1:06:30 (argument) a bill to get rid of Daylight Savings Time in Texas, Burnie likes when it gets dark earlier, Burnie: DST's purpose to reduce energy consumption (people aren't active in these hours), Gavin: you don't actually get more daylight from changing the clock

          #195 at 1:32:48-1:36:57 Gavin doesn't book or arrange his traveling, other people have to do it for him, Gus: "that's not your issue, your issue is you're a self-centered asshole" "surely someone will be taking care of Gavin Free", Gavin doesn't stress about stuff which makes everyone around him stress to get things done for him

              #359 at 1:43:16~1:44:00 also^ Gavin doesn't look at his newsfeed/timeline (at his followers, Gavin doesn't read..) he only reads mentions, Burnie: "So basically you follow yourself"
              #365 at 1:23:13 Gavin asks Burnie how he keeps track of everybody on social media and Burnie says "I care, that's it, that's my whole secret" (they say Gavin doesn't care about other people and their problems)

          #195 at 1:43:51-1:45:21 also about filling applications/paperwork and putting in effort, didn't receive payments for works because he needed to find a scanner and he didn't want to ("effort is difficult for me")

      #195 at ~7:41-8:39 Gavin forgot to go to do his makeup before the podcast and had to be reminded, Burnie: when you don't care/don't give a shit you end up filtering out of your life the people who do care and you're left surrounding yourself with people who equally don't give a shit.
      #201 at 50:09-51:25 Gavin said no to being asked to be the bestman at his friend's wedding because it's too much responsibility

      #215 at 59:24~1:02:45 Argument, what does Gavin's "can't be bothered" mean? ("I can't be bothered with the podcast" means "I'm not doing the podcast" not "I'm too tired to do the podcast but I'll do it anyway")
      #233 at 1:58-2:41 Gavin can't be bothered explaining things that he starts talking about, Burnie: You're a hipster onto yourself/You're cooler than yourself

(meeting strangers/taking to strangers), 2 girls chatted with Burnie and Gavin, "what's the point ... what am I going to say, I made a new friend who's a girl, that's not gonna help anyone", Gavin doesn't want to give girls the wrong idea/to lead them on (doesn't want to appear interested romantically, flirting)
          #430 at 21:03 Gavin had a Gus moment when he sat next to a woman at an airport who had the same battery charger as him so he didn't want to take his out because she might think for second that he took her charger

  #370 at 55:39 Gavin says he bruped in the bag right after they ended filming #350, April 15th 2014 (so it's after #267 and before #268)
      (#350) the end - the old control room, before #268 when they moved
  (#350) they talk about Guardians Of The Galaxy as something that "bombed" at the box office 'despite what Jack thought', so the podcast was probably recorded some time after #255 (~Feb 2014) which has the conversation with Jack about GOTG (on #258 they all have similar hair/facial hair so maybe around that time)
